## What is Uffizzi?

Uffizzi is a cloud-native REST API for managing lightweight, event-driven test environments on Kubernetes. It provides Development teams with an environments-as-a-service capability, while eliminating the need for Operations teams to configure and manage test infrastructure and tooling. 

## Use cases
Example use cases include rapidly creating PR/MR environments, preview environments, release environments, demo environments, and staging environments. 

## Why Uffizzi?

- **👩‍💻 Developer-friendly** - The Uffizzi API provides a simplified interface to Kubernetes, allowing you to define your application with Docker Comopose.

- **🪶 Lightweight** - Uffizzi test environments are isolated namespaces within a single cluster. This level of abstraction helps improve performance and use compute resources more efficiently.

- **🔁 Event-driven** - Designed to integrate with any CI/CD system, Uffizzi environments are created, updated, or deleted via triggering events, such as pull requests or new release tags. Uffizzi generates a secure HTTPS URL for each environment, which is continually updated in response to new events.

- **🧼 Clean** - The ephermeral nature of Uffizzi test environments means your team can test new features or release candidates in clean, parallel environments before merging or promoting to production.
